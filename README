4/11/2012:

These tutorials are now a reboot of my developer skills inside of the Brave New World of all-multicore, all-the-time devices. These tutorials will be augmented with blocks-based code as well as agressive property usage and other runtime tricks as appropriate.

The intention is to work through the following tutorial sets as quickly as possible:

BNR's iOS Programming, 2nd ed.
Rob Napier's iOS Programming: Pushing the Limits
BNR's Mac OS X Programming, 4th Ed.
BNR's Advanced Mac OS X Programming, 2nd Ed.
Zarra Studios' Core Animation Guide
Isted and Harrington's Core Data for iOS
Marcus Zarra's Core Data iDeveloper TV video series
Matt Long's Core Animation iDeveloper TV video series

(and whatever else strikes the fancy)
